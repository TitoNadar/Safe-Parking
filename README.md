### SafePark Android App

**SafePark** is a disruptive Android Application that provides a smarter solution to the existing **parking problems** at the crowded venues and equally effective in organizing the system at other venues as well. It works like **bookmyshow** app for parking systems, providing the users to book the desired parking slot at the requested location before 30 minutes.

### Motivation :
There lies an existing problem for **Parking spaces** and the cure to that is not increasing more such parking spaces or to decrease the number of cars which gives rise to an enormous amount of **unorganized traffic** causing people to lose a lot of time. These factors lead me to think of such a problem statement and find a better and scalable solution to the existing issue.

### Build status : 

Prototype Stage (Complete)

Production Stage (Under Process) 


### Tech used :
Java, Android Studio.

### Features :
The app gives the user the power to book a parking slot before 30 minutes and if he doesn't reach until 30 minutes then a notification is sent for the extra 5 minute buffer period that the app provides the user to get the parking spaces before it gets cancelled.

After the slot is booked user a QR code is generated which will help the user get into the  Parking spaces by means of scanning the QR code, this scanning will give the directions to the selected Parking slot. The second QR code is generated only when the car is parked in the selected slot, which confirms that the user has parked the car in the right slot. These features make the system organized, secure and automated.


### Future prospects :
Scalability of the product and if **Government collaboration** happens hope to use it at public places like Airports, Railway stations, etc.
